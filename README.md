# User Script Repository

This is an area where users can deposit their code if they think it will be helpful to others.

The repository is sorted by software package (Developer, InCarta, HALO etc.)

The prefered method is for users to upload both the raw scripts and an html guide - which can be generated via R markdown - within a subfolder under the specific software. 

Ideally these guides will describe the intended purpose of the code and the desired output. If the file sizes are small enough these can also be included. 

**DO NOT edit others code but rather branch to your own GitHub or download the raw files**
